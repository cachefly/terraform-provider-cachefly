# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we kindly request that you report it to us responsibly.

Please do not report the vulnerability publicly. This could potentially expose the vulnerability to malicious actors before a fix is available.

You can report vulnerabilities privately through our support team email address; support@cachefly.com
